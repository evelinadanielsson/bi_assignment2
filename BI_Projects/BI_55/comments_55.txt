The MDX queries could not be saved in .mdx format directly from Schema Workbench,
therefore they have been saved in .mdx format through a text editor.

BONUS:
The proposed star schema is not optimal. One problem in that the fact table
contains three different date keys (DueDateKey, ShipDateKey, OrderDateKey) which
point at DateKey in the Date dimension table. This can result in overlapping of
some date keys and should be resolved in order to find an optimal schema.
